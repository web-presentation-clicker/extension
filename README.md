# Web Presentation Clicker (on-stage.click)

You can download this extension [here for chromium-based browsers](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-presentation-clicker/mnkkbdgkehfhenamhggdljdmlpdpjmom) or [here for firefox-based browsers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-presentation-clicker/).

This extension uses a server application to relay events from your phone to this extension, the code for which is available [here](https://github.com/web-presentation-clicker/staged). 

You can even set up your own server, but the official extension currently lacks support for using a different server.
